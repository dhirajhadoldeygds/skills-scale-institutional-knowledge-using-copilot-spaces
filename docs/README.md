# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation! This README provides a high-level summary of our project management processes and direct links to our detailed guides.

## Summary of Project Management Processes

### Core Principles
- **Customer-focused:** Prioritize customer needs and satisfaction in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery:** Deliver value incrementally with regular feedback loops
- **Clear ownership:** Define clear accountability for decisions and deliverables
- **Data-driven decisions:** Base decisions on metrics, data, and evidence
- **Continuous improvement:** Regularly review and refine processes and outcomes

### Project Lifecycle

Our project management approach follows a structured lifecycle with five key phases:

1. **Initiation:** Define project scope, objectives, and stakeholders
2. **Planning:** Develop detailed plans, timelines, and resource allocations
3. **Execution:** Implement the plan, manage resources, and track progress
4. **Release:** Deploy solutions and manage transitions to production
5. **Retrospective:** Review outcomes and identify improvements for future projects
